Generated 11/18 for 400+ points (filtered to 400 successful runs)
Components assume floor 1 is ground, floor 4 is roof.
Assumes ground floor is 80-20 retail/office. The rest is 100% office.
Normative quantity estimation tool used for components, but some judgments used
	to remove components that would be unnaturally located.

Trimmed components on location
Many roof-specific components were generated by NQE to be on all locations
excessiveRID, irreparable, collapse cases are in components list but not tested
converted chiller/cooling/AHU units from tons to each
category E requires peak floor velocity, not yet collected
Dotted naming system
Remove duplicates, summing mean and variance
Added blocks based on previous examples

Changed pelicun config to Offset = 0
Works with EDP system PFA: 1-4, PID: 1-3
Checked components with PACT (correctly placed components considering EDP offset)
